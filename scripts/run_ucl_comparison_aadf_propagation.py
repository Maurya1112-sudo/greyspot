"""THE REAL network-source test - OS Open Roads (the paper's actual road
network), not an OSMnx approximation. Built 2026-09-02 after discovering
the "2GB source GeoPackage is gone from local disk" note in project
memory was simply WRONG - the file (`oproad_gpkg_gb/Data/oproad_gb.gpkg`,
1.02GB compressed, downloaded by the user 2026-09-01) was on disk the
whole time, just never actually exercised end-to-end until now.

**A real bug was found and fixed getting here** (see `ingest.os_open_roads`'s
own docstring/`docs/decision_log.md`): the existing loader only ever
bbox-clipped, never polygon-clipped, to the real administrative
boundary. For Westminster this pulled in 11,347 road links from a bbox
that extends well past the actual borough (e.g. across the Thames) -
polygon-clipping (endpoint-inside test, matching OSMnx's own
`graph_from_place` convention) cuts this to 5,549 links (11,098
directed edges). This is HIGHER than this project's own OSMnx graph
(7,552 directed edges) for the same borough - the OPPOSITE of the
"OS Open Roads is ~1.5x coarser" reading of the paper's thesis Table 7.2
that motivated the (separately, already-tested-negative) network-
consolidation experiment. Either the paper counts "roads" by some
different convention (e.g. named-street aggregation, not individual
link/junction-to-junction segments), or by a different boundary
definition - unresolved, but irrelevant to this script's actual
purpose: testing the REAL network's effect on AccHR@20 directly,
rather than reasoning from segment counts that may not be comparable
at all.

Otherwise identical to `run_ucl_comparison_multiwindow_poi_socio.py`
(same light protocol, same POI+socio-demographic features, same
heads=3 config) - only the road network source changes, isolating this
one variable against the current best-known configuration.

POI counts are cached under a NEW, network-specific key
(`{borough}_poi_counts_os_open_roads.csv`) since OS Open Roads assigns
completely different segment_ids than OSMnx - reusing the OSMnx POI
cache would silently key-mismatch (the same bug class caught and fixed
in the network-consolidation script).
