"""ARCHITECTURE ENSEMBLE - averaging structurally DIFFERENT models,
2026-09-03.

**Why this is not a repeat of the multi-seed ensemble** (which was a
clean null, p=0.6881): that averaged five runs of the SAME architecture,
which differ only by weight initialisation and therefore make highly
correlated errors - averaging correlated errors cannot help. This
averages models with genuinely different capacities and receptive
fields (hidden 16/32, 42/42, and 2-layer), which is the condition under
which ensembling actually reduces error.

**Why this is legitimate and not test-set selection.** A tempting but
INVALID alternative is to pick the best-performing configuration per
borough (42/42 scored best on Lambeth, 16/32 on Westminster) and report
the pooled result - that would be selecting on the evaluation windows,
optimistically biased, and would not replicate. Per-borough selection is
only sound when made on a VALIDATION split, and at 12 instances per
borough carving one out would leave ~3 test windows, which this project
has just demonstrated cannot resolve even a 10-point difference. This
script instead applies ONE fixed rule - average these three
architectures - identically to every borough and every window, with no
reference to test performance.

Predictions are averaged as per-day RANKS rather than raw scores: the
three models are separately calibrated and their raw magnitudes are not
directly comparable, whereas AccHR@20 depends only on within-day rank
order.
